		  Notes on Windows Kernel Debugging
		  ---------------------------------

Windows implements a low-level debugging interface called Kernel
Debugging (WKD) which obtains control very early in the startup
sequence of Windows.  The program WDEB386 shipped with the Windows SDK
is an example of one such program; 386SWAT is another.

When Windows sees that a kernel debugger is present, it informs the
debugger about a number of events as they occur, principally parameter
errors made by running Windows programs as they call Windows API
functions.	For example, if a program calls EnableWindow with an
invalid window handle (say, zero), this error is passed on to the WKD
for processing before returning to the calling program.  In this way,
a great many errors can be caught before they can cause any harm.

By default, 386SWAT is a WKD.  If, for some reason, you wish to
disable this feature, place the keyword NOWINK into your 386SWAT
profile.

At the current time, you must have a monochrome adapter and monitor
attached to your system in order for WKD services to be allowed by
386SWAT.  386SWAT tests for a mono card and disables WKD if not found.


New Command Line Actions
------------------------

* To enable or disable WKD services entirely, use

	WKD [ON|OFF]

  This option is available outside Windows only.  If you have
  specified NOWINK in the 386SWAT profile, this option has no effect
  -- you must remove that profile option and reboot the system to
  enable WKD services.

* To change the response to a parameter error, use

	WKD [NOISY|QUIET]

  If NOISY is specified, then each parameter error is followed by the
  prompt "Break, Ignore, Quiet?" to which you must respond B, I, or
  Q.

  A response of Q, is equivalent to setting WKD QUIET after which
  parameter errors are logged to the screen, but execution does not
  stop for any more parameter errors until you break into 386SWAT and
  type WKD NOISY on 386SWAT's command line.  This is the default
  state, so you'll see parameter errors fly past on the mono screen
  without pause.  I recommend that when you are debugging your own
  code, use WKD NOISY; otherwise, use WKD QUIET.  This is because many
  commercial packages contain so many parameter errors that you'll
  constantly be interrupted with a BIQ prompt.

  A response of I, ignores this one error only and continues
  execution.

  A response of B, triggers a single step breakpoint at an IRETD
  inside 386SWAT.  Tracing over this instruction returns to the
  instruction inside Windows immediately following the call to
  386SWAT (typically an INT 41h).  Tracing from this point on
  eventually gets you back to a call to LogError which was called by
  the Windows API function which encountered the invalid parameter,
  and then back to the application which called the Windows API with
  an invalid parameter.  If the application is Win32, then you'll have
  to trace back through a thunking layer before you get to the
  application.	This can be quite tricky.  At some point, I'll try to
  put in some stack tracing to aid this process.

* Sometimes Windows and/or applications make direct calls to LogError
  as opposed to indirect calls as part of a parameter error.  These
  calls are uncommon, so there is a separate switch to control
  386SWAT's response to such an event.  Use

	WKD LOGERROR [ON|OFF]

  to change the response of stopping at an IRETD inside 386SWAT or
  not.	The default setting is OFF.

* Sometimes an application is bad enough that it triggers an
  unrecoverable fault (typically a GP or Page Fault) and it must be
  terminated.  Windows gives the WKD a crack at it first to which
  386SWAT responds by stopping in the application at the faulting
  instruction, thus giving you the opportunity to debug the problem.
  If you wish to tell Windows to handle the fault itself (typically
  by terminating the application), use

	WKD FAULT SKIP

  If you do not want to receive any more fault messages from Windows,
  use

	WKD FAULT OFF

  To restart receiving fault messages, use

	WKD FAULT ON

* The keystroke Ctrl-K brings up a menu from which you can choose to
  display various internal Windows structures.	At the moment, the
  only one which has been fleshed out is the display of the Windows
  Global Heap (WGH).  The WGH contains one entry for each globally
  allocated region of memory.  For example, the various code and data
  segments of KRNL386.EXE are global allocations and have entries in
  this table.  To scroll through this table, use the usual up and down
  arrow keys as well as Page Up and Page Down.

  To search through the WGH for a specific entry, use the SGH command:

  SGH [/b|/s|/h|/o] [/c] expr

  The expression (expr) entered is interpreted as a base address if /b
  is specified, size if /s, handle if /h, and owner if /o.  If /c is
  specified, the search continues from the currently displayed entry;
  otherwise, the search starts at the top of the heap.	If the value
  is found in the WGH, the WGH is displayed with the matching entry at
  the top of the screen.  If you wish to repeat the search (perhaps
  becayse there are multiple entries with the same owner), either
  retype the command (and specify /c so the search continues with the
  next entry after the one at the top of the screen), or start the
  command with a slash so it is not erased after successful execution.
  If the value is not found in the WGH, an error message is displayed.

* If Invalid Page Faults are being trapped by SWAT's VxD (see
  SWATVXD.DOC for more details), use the IPF command to control how
  these events are to be handled.

  IPF [/d] [/s] [/r] expr

  where /d tells SWAT not to display a message on the mono screen
  describing this event, /s tells SWAT not to stop when this event
  occurs, /r tells SWAT to remove this entry from its local tables,
  and expr is an expression which evaulates to a linear address
  corresponding to the Invalid Page Fault.

* To display the memory pointed to by a selector as a Module Database,
  use

  MDB expr

* To display the memory pointed to by a selector as a Task Database,
  use

  TDB expr

* Certain commands usually preceded with a dot are automatically
  passed to Windows for processing by WIN386, assuming Windows is
  active and WIN386 services are available.  These commands include

  ?		Display a Help screen with the available commands
  .?		Display a list of registered dot commands (e.g., .M)
  .R [#]	Display the registers of the current thread (or thread #)
  .VM [#]	Display the complete VM status of the current VM (or #)
  .VC [#]	Display the current VM's (or #) control block
  .VH [#]	Display a VMM linked list, given list handle
  .VR [#]	Display the registers of the current VM (or #)
  .VS [#]	Display the current VM's (or #) virtual stack
  .VL		Display list of all valid VM handles
  .DS		Display protected mode stack with labels
  .VMM		Display menu of VMM state info
  .<dev_name>	Display device-specific info



Profile Options
---------------

Because 386SWAT is a WKD, it is given much more information to
process.  Much of that data is stored in its internal log file
(acessible via Ctl-F10) which means that you should increase the log
file's default size.  You might experiment with different values, but
I suggest using something on the order of LOGSIZE=100000.

During Windows startup while still in RM/VM, Windows loads the real
mode portion of all of the VxDs to be used this Windows session.  At
this time, Windows tells the WKD about these VxDs and where they will
be loaded in memory when in PM, and 386SWAT logs this information in
two ways.

The first way is to write a line to the mono display with the data
about each segment (code or data) of the form

Loaded VxD <VxDname>, module <Modname> at <address> len <length>

The second way is to append a symbol to 386SWAT's symbol table of the
form <VxDname>_Code<nnnn> or <VxDname>_Data<nnnn>, where <nnnn> is a
decimal sequence number starting at 1 and is used to distinguigh one
code/data segment from another.  By convention in Windows, code
segments are in selector 0028h and data segments are in selector
0030h.	These symbols are useful when debugging VxDs.

In order to save this information, you need to tell 386SWAT how much
space to reserve.  The profile option WKDLS (Load Segments) is used
for this purpose.  The actual value depends upon how many VxD code and
data segments are loaded on your system.  I use WKDLS=700.	If you
have no interest in debugging VxDs, omit this profile option as the
default value is zero which reserves no space.	You might also want to
increase the profile value for SYMSIZE.  I use SYMSIZE=700000 (you do
have 32MB of RAM, don't you?).


Debugging DLLs
--------------

The Windows SDK (3.1x or 95) contains separate copies of various
system DLLs each of which which contain more messages and checks on
Windows execution.  I haven't played with these much, so you're on
your own, but it may be very worthwhile.  They also contain symbol
files which I haven't put in code to load as yet.


SWAT VxD
--------

This version of 386SWAT no longer requires that you load SWATVXD.EXE
as a resident program (thus saving you a few bytes of DOS memory), but
the VxD must be in same directory as 386SWAT.LOD.  The VxD is now
loaded by 386SWAT when Windows starts up.  See the file SWATVXD.DOC
for more information on how to configure the VxD.


Loading 386SWAT
---------------

If you are running 386MAX as your memory manager, you could load
386SWAT from the 386MAX profile with the LOAD= keyword.  However,
because this mechanism doesn't provide for 386SWAT to have a DOS
footprint and such a footprint is needed for WKDing, I do not
recommend loading SWAT this way anymore.  Instead, load 386SWAT as a
device driver on the line which immediately follows the line which
loads the memory manager.  386SWAT must load in low DOS memory, so
don't try to load it high.  The low DOS memory footprint of 386SWAT is
about 2KB.
