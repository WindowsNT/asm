SWATVXD  -- Version 3.02 -- A Debugger for WIN386
   (C) Copyright 1990-8 Qualitas, Inc.	All rights reserved.

The SWATVXD.EXE file is the accompanying VxD to 386SWAT.  As long as
it is in the same directory as the debugger file (386SWAT.LOD), it is
loaded automatically by 386SWAT.  If for some reason you don't wish
that to happen, using the command "WIN NOSWAT" prevents the VxD from
loading.


Switches
--------

The VxD provides Windows services for 386SWAT, and is useful for
debugging VxDs.

The VxD's operation is controlled by various switches all of which
appear in the [386SWAT] section of your SYSTEM.INI file.

SWATDualDisplay
  Squirt cool info to the mono display -- you must use this option to
get the most useful output to the mono screen.

SSF=d:\path\name.SSF
  Specify the WIN.SSF file -- this file is generated when SWAT VxD is
built and contains useful symbol information about Windows VxDs.

SWATVxDROM
  In Sys_Critical_Init, mark the Page Table Entries of all VxD code
segments as read-only (normally, they are read-writable!).	This
feature was implemented in an attempt to figure out why Windows was
crashing (I thought that there might be a bad pointer out there).
While I didn't find anything in particular, it is handy to rule out
this problem.  If a VxD code segment is written into, an Invalid Page
Fault is generated (see below).  Likely, you'll find that a single IPF
due to this feature is generated at the start of Windows.  The default
action (taken by pressing Esc at the command line) is to test for a RO
page and set the RW bit.  This clears the IPF for this one page only.
From that point on, all IPFs should be examined carefully.	If this
switch is set, the SWATVxDIPF and SWATPL0WP switches are also set
automatically.

SWATVxDIPF
  In Sys_Critical_Init, hook the Invalid Page Fault handler.  This
feature, in conjunction with the IPF command in SWAT can be useful for
debugging these beasts.  The mono screen contains a formatted message
of the incoming data to the IPF hook procedure.  This feature is
preliminary and provides a way to get control at the point of the IPF
-- after that, you're on your own.  If you can suggest more things
SWAT can do to help debug IPFs, I'm very open to suggestions.

SWATPL0WP
  In Sys_Critical_Init, set the WP bit in CR0 so we can trap writes
into Read-Only pages at PL0.

HookIRQ
  Hook IRQ0-7 locally if SWAT hooks them.  This switch is necessary
for some VxDs (RAM Doubler in particular) as they don't install
correctly if they find some IRQs not hooked by selector 28h.  Go
figure.


Debugging VxDs
--------------

To debug VxDs at their entry points, use the following switches:

HookVxD=DDB_Name[,#s]
  Trap at a particular VxD by name.  Note that <DDB_Name> is case
sensitive, and <#> specifies message numbers (optional).  See the VxD
Filename and Message # tables below.

HookPM=DDB_Name,reg,#
  Trap at a particular VxD's PM API entry.  <reg> specifies a 16-bit
register used by the VxD for the function code, and <#> specifies the
functions to trap.	For example, HookPM=SHELL,DX,3 traps at the
WINOLDAP hook

Internal Use Only
-----------------

The following switches are for internal use only.

SSFPrefix=name
  Specify device name and DDB prefix.

SWATDebugThruExit
  Call SWAT's INIT_PROT during Critical_Exit.  This allows debugging
on the way out of SWAT.  Now that SWAT is a Windows kernel debugger,
this switch is unnecessary.

RealModeBreak=ON/OFF
  Hit an INT 1 early in RealModeInit.

Rehook123=ON/OFF
  Blast INTs 1, 2, and 3 into the IDT.	To avoid trouble with WDEB386.
Now that SWAT is a Windows kernel debugger, there should be less need
to run WDEB386.
