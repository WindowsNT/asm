386SWAT symbolic debugging

This document covers the basics of symbolic debugging support for
386SWAT.  The 386SWAT API specifics are documented in SYMBOLS.TXT; here we
will describe actual usage of SWAT for symbolic debugging, and the
tools needed to load symbols.

There are three sections:
386SWAT - new profile options and commands
SWATRUN - program loader for debugging .COM and .EXE files
MAPSSF	- symbol loader/translator

386SWAT
Three profile options are new to SWAT:

SYMSIZE=n	This option sets the number of bytes to be used for the
		SWAT symbol table.  The internal format of SWAT's symbol
		table is 12 bytes larger than the symbol table used for
		the SWAT API calls.  Each public or line number occupies
		23 bytes plus the length of the symbol name.

		SYMSIZE is used to calculate a default value for BUCKETS
		(described below).  If BUCKETS is not explicitly defined
		in the profile, it will be set to min (255, max (1,
		SYMSIZE / 4096)).

		If SYMSIZE is not specified, it will default to 4096 bytes.
		The default BUCKETS value (if also not specified) will then
		be 1.  See below for BUCKETS storage requirements.

		Use SYMSIZE=0 to minimize symbol storage requirements.
		This will save 4K over the default.

BUCKETS=n	Specify number of 1K blocks to be used for symbol name
		hashing.  Values less than 1 and over 255 are ignored.

		To speed symbol name searches, all names are hashed using
		the following algorithm:

		extern unsigned int HASHPRIME;

		int hashpjw(char *s)
		{
		 char *p;
		 unsigned long h=0, g;

		 for (p=s; *p; p++) {
			h = (h << 4) + (unsigned) tolower (*p);
			if (g = (h & 0xf0000000)) {
			  h = h ^ (g >> 24);
			  h = h ^ g;
			}
		 }

		 return ((int) (h % HASHPRIME));

		}

		HASHPRIME is derived from a table of prime numbers closest
		to multiples of 256.  Here are some examples:
		BUCKETS 	HASHPRIME
		1		257
		2		509
		3		769
		254		65027
		255		65287

		The storage occupied by the name hashing table is
		HASHPRIMES[BUCKETS-1] * 4, or approximately BUCKETS * 1K.

		When a hash value is calculated from a name, that value is
		shifted left 2 bits and used as an index into the table
		of dword bucket pointers based at the address contained
		in SYMNHASH.  A bucket pointer may contain -1 (FFFFFFFF)
		or an offset from the address contained in SYMBASE.  In
		this case, a "bucket" actually points to a symbol record.
		Next name pointers in each symbol record form a linked
		list which may be traversed to find an exact name match.

		The smaller the BUCKETS value, the longer these bucket
		chains will be, thus increasing name search time.  This
		is only likely to be a performance hit when loading
		symbols, since SWAT checks for existing symbols by name.
		Searches for symbols entered at the command line would
		not be visibly impacted by longer searches.

ADDRHBITS=n	Specify number of address bits to use for address hash
		table.	Values less than 8 and over 12 are ignored.

		Address hash table storage in bytes is 2 ^ (ADDRHBITS + 2).
		The minimum is therefore 1K and the maximum, 16K.

		ADDRHBITS defaults to 12.  When symbols are present,
		all possible addresses in the disassembly screen
		are searched against the address hash table.  Possible
		hits require traversal of the address hash buckets chain,
		similar to name hash bucket traversal.	A "next address
		bucket" pointer is part of the symbol record.  Thus the
		set of symbol records forms two interleaved linked lists:
		the address bucket chain and the name bucket chain.

		The number of bits specified by ADDRHBITS are taken from
		a resolved linear address, shifted left 2 bits, and used
		as an index into the table of dword pointers based at the
		address contained in SYMNHASH.	The address pointed to is
		an offset from the address in SYMBASE, and points to the
		beginning symbol record in that address bucket chain.  If
		the value is -1 (FFFFFFFF), there is no such address.

		Smaller address hash tables may significantly impact
		unassembly.

Using symbols

Any symbol may be used as an effective address.  For example,

dd 180|{SYMHASH

will display the symbol address hash table.  Symbol display will occur
automatically if the symbols are loaded properly.  See sections below
on SWATRUN and MAPSSF.

Symbols are displayed in the Unassemble (F9) screen.  Code addresses
may be displayed as public names or line numbers (if line numbers
were specified with the linker's /LI option).  Addresses within the
unassembly are handled as intelligently as possible.  For example,

mov ax,[bx+7c39]

may be displayed as

mov ax,[bx+FOOBAR]

if FOOBAR's offset is 7c39 and the default segment/selector (DS in this case)
matches the segment/selector specified for the symbol FOOBAR.

SWAT can now resolve addresses CLOSE TO symbols; a construction commonly
seen in C code might be:

mov [FOOBAR],bx
mov [7c3b],es

SWAT will disassemble this as

mov [FOOBAR],bx
mov [FOOBAR+02],es

The PROXSRCH variable determines how far SWAT continues proximity searches
and with what granularity.  The default is 1 word.  Currently, the only
way to change this is by editing the memory location where PROXSRCH is
stored.  The high order byte of PROXSRCH contains the granularity in bytes,
and the low order byte contains the number of units to search.	The default
is 0201h.  0108h would do byte granular searches from x+1 to x+8.

Proximity searches should not visibly impact disassembly performance.
A separate check for an empty symbol table ensures that no time is
wasted in unnecessary calls to the symbol search routine (which has
its own check for empty tables).  No proximity searches are done for
label display and data display; this only affects values within the
disassembly.

A future enhancement would be to implement a profile option to set
PROXSRCH.  It should also be settable from the command line.

Another useful feature would be to turn off case sensitivity when searching
for symbol matches.  This is more of an issue when debugging C code. Again,
it could be settable in the profile as well as from the command line.

New commands within SWAT

The Translate Symbols (TS) command may be used to adjust segment/selector
values, as well as to add a constant to symbol offsets, after the symbols
are loaded.  This is needed for debugging the VXD.  The VXD symbols would
be loaded with MAPSSF, using a .wsg file to assign selector values and
group ID's to the different linker groups.  Once SWATVXD has located the
offsets of the different VXD groups, they may be translated one at a time.

For example, the VXD's DGROUP is assigned selector 28, group ID 2001, and
IGROUP is assigned selector 30, group ID 2002.	The .WSG file entries are:

  2001	P	28	DGROUP		; Comments
  2002	P	30	IGROUP		; More comments

We load the .MAP file before entering Windows:

MAPSSF -wVXD.WSG VXD.MAP

We find that the offsets within the Windows flat model segment are
DGROUP	8001BE24
IGROUP	8020397C

The TS command is used to translate both groups:

ts 28 2001 P 28 8001BE24
ts 30 2002 P 30 8020397C

The complete syntax of the TS command is:

TS osel ogrp nflag nsel nbase

osel	Old selector value
ogrp	Target group value (unless specified in .WSG file, 0)
nflag	P for PM symbols
	V for VM symbols
nsel	New selector value (in above example, unchanged)
nbase	Base value to be added to all symbol offsets


SWATRUN

Syntax: SWATRUN [options] progname [arguments]

SWATRUN is a program loader for debugging V86 mode programs.  It
creates a breakpoint before the first instruction of the target
program, and will also attempt to load symbols into SWAT via the
VCPI debugger API with the appropriate segment fixup.

If no file extension is specified, SWATRUN looks first for a .COM
file then an .EXE file.  The filename specified is converted into
a fully qualified pathname including drive letter, directory, and
extension.  SWATRUN will load this file using the undocumented DOS
function 4B01 to determine the segment fixup.

SWATRUN will then look for a matching .SSF file, and
if found, will load it directly into SWAT.  If an .SSF file is not
found, SWATRUN will look for a matching .MAP file.  If a .MAP file
is found, SWATRUN will invoke MAPSSF with the proper parameters
to fixup and load the parsed .MAP file.  See the section on MAPSSF
for further information on .MAP file formats supported and on
creation of .SSF files.  .SSF file loading is faster, but does not
currently report symbol allocation table shortages.  If your
symbols do not appear to be loaded from an .SSF file, delete
the .SSF file.	SWATRUN will try to load symbols from the .MAP file
with MAPSSF.  MAPSSF will report any changes required to the
386SWAT.PRO file.


  Valid SWATRUN options are:

    /b	 Generate Int 1 at beginning of SWATRUN
	 This is useful only for debugging the loading process

    /mMAPFILE Load MAPFILE instead of progname.map
	 If no .SSF file is present, SWATRUN constructs a map file
	 name by taking the path and basename of the .EXE or .COM
	 file and adding .MAP.	This filename is passed to MAPSSF
	 if it exists.	This option may be used to specify a map
	 file on another drive:directory.

    /n	 Do not load symbols
	 If SWATRUN has already run once, the target program did not
	 go resident, and symbols were loaded, run SWATRUN with this
	 option on subsequent invocations.

    /o	 Overwrite existing SWAT symbols
	 This option is passed to MAPSSF.  Any existing symbols will
	 be destroyed.

    /sSYMFILE Load SYMFILE instead of progname.ssf
	 SWATRUN normally constructs a .ssf file name by taking
	 the path and basename of the .EXE or .COM file and adding
	 .SSF.	If this file exists and is in the proper format
	 created by MAPSSF, it will be loaded into 386SWAT.

MAPSSF

This program is called by SWATRUN to load .MAP files on the fly.
It may also be used to produce .SSF files for loading at CONFIG.SYS time
(not currently supported by SWAT).  .SSF files may also be loaded
directly by SWATRUN.  This is faster than calling MAPSSF every time
symbols are loaded.

Besides reading .MAP files, MAPSSF will also process Windows SYM32 files.
MAPSSF has been tested with the following .MAP file formats:
- Microsoft LINK
- Microsoft LINK386 flat model
- Borland TLINK

Syntax:

MapSSF [options] fspec1 [fspec2 [...]]

All options are preceded with - or /:

  -g#,# 	restrict symbol group types to specified #'s
		(SYM32 files only)  Only symbols with group types matching
		one of these values will be loaded.  The group type in
		SYM32 files is NOT the same as the group ID defined
		in a .WSG file.

  -l		ignore line number information in .MAP file
		This option may be used to suppress loading of line number
		symbols when space is at a premium.  Typically, line
		numbers take about 80% of symbol space.

  -o		overwrite existing symbol table (default is append)
		Normally, new symbols are added to SWAT.  Existing
		symbols will be updated.  This option forces the
		symbol table to be flushed at the beginning of MAPSSF.

  -sxxxxm	set selector to xxxx hex, where m is
		v for V86/real mode
		v+ for V86/real mode, add value to segment,
		p for protected mode
		The -sxxxxv+ form is used by SWATRUN to add a fixup to all
		segment values.

  -tfname	echo SWAT tables to file fname
		This option may be used to create a file in SWAT symbol
		format (.ssf file).

  -wfname[.wsg] read Windows Symbol Group file fname.wsg
		This feature may be used for .MAP files or for .SYM files.
		As an example, the QMAX.WSG file contains:

; group mode	sel	group[!segment]

  3000	P	50	PGROUP		; 386MAX code
  3001	P	18	PGROUP!EDATA	; 386MAX data
  3001	P	18	PGROUP!VALSEG	; 386MAX data
  0	D	 0	PGROUP!NCODE	; 386MAX non-resident code
  0	D	 0	PGROUP!NDATA	; 386MAX non-resident data
  3002	P      118	IGROUP!ICODE	; 386MAX extra code
  3003	P      120	IGROUP!IDATA	; 386MAX extra data
  0	D	 0	XGROUP		; 386MAX non-resident code/data
  0	D	 0	PSPGRP		; PSP group (non-resident)
  3004	P	70	PDTGRP		; OFFPDT group (uninitialized)

		Note that all groups listed with unique segment values
		in the Group section of the MAP file are listed.  The
		real mode groups XGROUP and PSPGRP will not be loaded.

		Association of public symbols with groups is sometimes
		not sufficient.  Both code and data are in PGROUP, but
		different selectors are used.  We therefore specify the
		individual data segments within PGROUP that will be
		assigned selector 18 (EDATA and VALSEG).  Since segments
		are more completely specified in the MAP file than
		groups, MAPSSF will check for segment matches before
		checking for group matches.  We also use this mechanism
		to avoid loading the NCODE and NDATA segments within
		PGROUP.

		Group matches are made by checking group origin values,
		which are sorted by value in descending order, against
		addresses.  ALL groups which COULD include an address,
		from highest to lowest, are checked for inclusion in
		the .WSG file.	The first match determines what changes
		are made to the matching symbol address.

  -v		sort symbols by value (default is by name)
		This option controls which section of the .MAP file is
		read.  If included on the command line, the "By Value"
		section is read.  By default, the "By Name" section is
		read.  By controlling the order in which symbols are passed
		to SWAT, the display in SWAT's Ctrl-F6 screen may be
		sorted by name or by value.

  -x#		set debugging level to # (default is 0 -- no messages)
		This is useful for debugging only.

  -y		default to recognizing files as SYM32 format
		Normally, MAPSSF recognizes files as .MAP or .SYM by
		their extension.  If neither extension is used, this
		option forces recognition as SYM32.
