Documentation for KEYBIN.COM

Use this program on an international keyboard to help the author of
386SWAT support your keyboard.

First try out the program to see how it works (note Space bar to
Exit).	Next redirect the program's output to a file and type all keys
(blindly).

Type every key on your keyboard except for function, arrow, and keypad
keys.  Type every key in unshifted state as well as with the Shift-,
Control-, and Alt-keys.  If your keyboard distinguishes between the
left and right Shift-, Control-, and/or Alt-keys be sure to test all
states for all keys.

After exiting the program, annotate the output file with any comments
you consider appropriate.  Finally, e-mail the file to the author (see
the address at the bottom of the 386SWAT.DOC file).
