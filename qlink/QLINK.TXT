QLINK Documentation File

Overview
--------

QLINK is a DOS linker and analysis tool designed to link together
MS-DOS compatible .OBJ files.  It can replace the MS-DOS LINK.EXE
program when producing MS-DOS compatible .EXE and .COM files.


Installation
------------

Make a directory (e.g., C:\QLINK), copy the zip file to that
directory, and unzip the files:

MD C:\QLINK
CD C:\QLINK
COPY A:\QLINK.ZIP
PKUNZIP QLINK.ZIP

If you'll be running QLINK under Windows 3.1x (see below for Win95
instructions), copy the file WINDPMI.386 to your Windows system
directory.  For example, if you installed Windows into the directory
C:\WINDOWS, copy WINDPMI.386 to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.  Then edit your
Windows SYSTEM.INI file to insert a line such as the following in the
[386ENH] section:

    device=windpmi.386

You should first ensure that no other similar line already appears in
your SYSTEM.INI file.  For example, you might already have a line such
as

    device=c:\bc4\bin\windpmi.386

If this is the case, do not insert another call to the same driver;
you need only one.  This VxD does not work with Win9x.

If you'll be running QLINK under Win9x, follow the above procedure
using the file W95DPMI.386 instead of WINDPMI.386.



Benefits
--------

* One pass linker (using uncommitted memory in DPMI 1.0)

* Better performance (typically twice as fast as MS LINK, sometimes
  ten times faster)

* Handles USE32 segments > 64KB

* Detailed error checking to the point that it becomes a highly
  valuable analysis tool

* Detailed error information (e.g., source code line number info (if
  in .OBJ file) for fixup overflows)

* Type checking between .OBJ files (if in .OBJ files)


System Requirements
-------------------

* MS-DOS 3.x or later

* DPMI host which supports DPMI 1.0 calls -- use either 386MAX version
  7.0 or later, or Windows 3.1x with a (supplied) VxD from Borland
  (WINDPMI.386), or DPMIONE (see http://www.sudleyplace.com/dpmione/).


How To Use
----------

For the most part, just call QLINK instead of LINK or TLINK as
appropriate.  Borland users should note that a number of
Borland-specific Object Module Formats (OMFs) are not implemented as
yet (I'm waiting for the documentation from Borland).  Several MS link
switches are not supported as yet (e.g., /PACKC).  If there are
switches you particularly need which are not supported, let me know.
For an explanation of the old linker switches, see your linker manual.


Tips
----

To take advantage of the detailed error processing in QLINK, use the
assembler switches which generate types and line numbers.  For MASM
and TASM these switches are /Zd and /Zi.


Segment Ordering
----------------

The order in which segments appear in the executable file depends on
several factors.  The first is whether or not the /DOSSEG switch
appears explicitly on the command line or implicitly in a OMF record
in one of the .OBJ files.

If /DOSSEG is specified, the segment order is as follows:

* All segments with a class name ending in 'CODE'
* All other segments not in DGROUP
* DGROUP segments in the following order:
  * Any segments of class 'BEGDATA'
  * Any segment not of class 'BEGDATA', 'BSS', or 'STACK'
  * Segments of class 'BSS'
  * Segments of class 'STACK'

Otherwise, the segment order is as follows:

* All unclassed segments
* All classed segments by class (that is, segments in the same class
  appear adjacent to each other).


Error Messages
--------------

There are a number of switches specific to QLINK which are documented
in the file QLINK.CFG.	These switches control the processing of error
messages from QLINK.  All error messages begin with either

ออ> WARN:

or

ออ> FAIL:

Messages which begin with WARN are warnings and do not halt the
linker.  Messages which being with FAIL cause the linker to stop
immediately and not continue processsing the input files.

If an error message is followed by a name such as FIXOVF or GRPEXT0 in
parentheses, then that error can be controlled by the switches
/I:switch, /W:switch, and /F:switch, where 'switch' is the name in
parentheses in the error message.

If you wish to ignore this error (meaning the linker takes a default
action and continues processing), use /I:switch.  To warn about an
error (meaning an error message is displayed, the linker takes a
default action, and continues processing), use /W:switch.  The default
settings for all error messages are described in the file QLINK.CFG.

This same file (QLINK.CFG) is consulted when QLINK begins execution.
Any switches found there (including switches such as /MAP, /LINE,
etc.) are processed before the command line is parsed.	Switches only
may be contained in QLINK.CFG, not names of .OBJ files, etc.  Even
earlier in the process, the environment variable QLINK= is consulted,
and it too may contain only switches.

Thus the order of processing of switches is first, those contained in
the environment variable QLINK=, then those in the file QLINK.CFG
(first in the current directory, and if not found there in the
directory from which QLINK is loaded), and finally those found on the
command line to QLINK.	Switches processed later in the sequence
override ones processed ealier.


Name Substitutions
------------------

Occasionally, you want to link together .OBJ modules from different
projects which use different naming conventions.  For example, in one
project code segments are in class 'CODE' and in others they are in
class 'PROG'.  Previously, you would have to edit the source code,
make the changes, and re-compile.  With the Name Substitution feature
of QLINK, it's a snap.

To substitute names on the fly within the .OBJ file, place the switch
/NS before the reference to each .OBJ file whose names are to be
substituted.  For example, use /NS:PROG-CODE to tell QLINK that the
name 'PROG' is to be changed to 'CODE'.

Each substitution is effective for all .OBJ files which appear after
it until that substitution (or all substitutions) are halted.  Use the
form /NS:name to halt substitutions on 'name'; use /NS with no
arguments to halt all substitutions.

Note that this means that the occurrences of /NS are sensitive to the
position and order in which they appear.  Be sure to place occurrences
of /NS before the reference to the .OBJ file to which they apply.

To swap two symbols in the same file, use (say) /NS:A-B:B-A.

The substitution is made on all references to the name regardless of
context.  Thus if you have a file with a segment named PROG and a
class named PROG, substituting CODE for PROG changes both references.

The full syntax is

Nameset:    (empty)	    ; Halt substitution on all names
	  | name	    ; Halt substitution on this name
	  | name '-' name   ; Substitute the second name for the
			    ; first name

Namedef:    Nameset
	  | Namedef ':' Nameset

Switch:     '/NS:' Namedef

The keyword /NS may appear in the QLINK environment variable, the
QLINK.CFG configuration file, the automatic response file, and the
QLINK command line.


Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q:  When I link modules with the MS linker and QLINK, sometimes the
    executable files are of very different sizes?
A:  This can occur if a .LIB is used to resolve external references.
    Because there is no rule as to the order in which external refs
    are processed, different ordering of these references mean that
    there can be different segment boundary alignments which can
    change the final executable file size.


Future Work
-----------

In no particular order of importance (nor of expectation of getting
done), the following topics are on my list:

* Support Borland-specific OMFs

* Support MS-specific OMFs (for which I don't have any examples)

* External procedure for symbol processing (instead of reading .MAP
  file)

* Allow segment attribute changes per .OBJ file

* Generate Windows-compatible .EXEs

* Generate Codeview information

* Generate Turbo Debugger information

* Compress .EXE using LZH or some such technique (for Windows
  executables as well)

* Finish type checking of structures

Please feel free to add to this list.

	* Added references to DPMIONE as a DPMI 1.0 host under which
	  QLINK runs.

5.03	21 July 2002
	* Modified the change in version 5.00 for fixup overflows to
	  treat the Target Displacement as a signed number and then
	  ignore overflows if the upper 24- (for byte fixups) or
	  16-bits (for word fixups) are all ones.

5.02	1 July 2002
	* Fix bug where a MODEND fixup generating any kind of error
	  causes the routine which displays the .OBJ file name to fail
	  (thanks to Vladomir Rodriquez for pointing this out).

5.01	26 June 2002
	* Fix bug where .MAP file occasionally not written out.
	* Display segment combine type in /MAP:FULL.
	* Fix bug in display of line #s for grouped segments which are
	  not first in the group.
	* Append IGNOREd errors to .ERR file if /DEBUG:ERR in effect.
	* Added FIXOVF$ switch to ignore fixup overflows in '$$SYMBOLS'
	  segments.
	* Fix bug when parsing command line and/or .ARF file if
	  leading '+' in multiple entry (.OBJ or .LIB) fields.

5.00	26 June 2002
	* Change version # to 5 to workaround bug in EXEHDR.
	* Fix bug in display of FRMSEG$ message.
	* Display error message if not enough memory to enter PM
	  through the DPMI host.
	* Fix bug when checking for fixup overflows where the displacement

1.30	22 June 2002
	* Added MTOBJ switch to fail on empty .OBJ files which can occur
	  when a language translator creates an object file but halts for
	  some reason before writing anything to it.

1.29	18 April 2002
	* Fix bug to change ignore/warn action on OMFUNK to ignore the
	  record.

1.28	25 April 2000
	* Fix bug handling weak externs if the symbol is already public.

1.27	18 April 2000
	* Implement support for COMDAT records.
	* Avoid searching through duplicate library names.
	* Handle blank line in ARF file as field marker.
	* Allow library directories in libfiles part of the command line.

1.26	10 April 2000
	* Extend checking for FRMSEG, FRMSEG0, and FRMSEG$ to the FT01
	  case.
	* Define RELTGT switch to catch the case where a self-relative
	  fixup's Frame and Target segments are different in the FT00
	  case.

1.25	7 April 2000
	* Extend checking for RELGRP errors in self-relative fixups to the

	  fixups to the FT20 and FT21 cases.
	* Extend checking for RELSEG errors in self-relative fixups to the
	  FT01 case.

1.24	4 April 2000
	* Extend Name Substitutions to PUBDEF and EXTDEF records (it
	  previously applied to LNAMES & LLNAMES records only).
	* Extend Name Substitutions to .LIB files.

1.23	30 March 2000
	* Define FRMSEG$ switch to catch the case where a FRMSEG error
	  occurs in a fixup segment named '$$SYMBOLS'.  This reduces some
	  of the noise when linking with debugging info.  The default
	  action is to ignore the error.
	* Fix bug when an external mixed-case symbol precedes the matching
	  public declaration of the same symbol in a different case.

1.22	30 March 2000
	* Implement /NS keyword to handle name substitutions.
	* Implement additional debugging display for fixups via
	  /DEBUG:FIXUP.

1.21	28 March 2000
	* Force /NOE as I can't figure out how it works.  I thought I
	  understood it, but now I'm convinced I do not.

1.20	24 March 2000
	* Implement /FARCALL.
	* Fix bugs when recognizing special class, segment, and group
	  names (wasn't case-insensitive and was off by one in length
	  when comparing names).

1.19	22 March 2000
	* Define FRMSEG0 switch to reduce the number of spurious FRMSEG
	  messages in the case where the segment is the first one in the
	  group.  In this case, the fixup value is the same independent
	  of whether the fixup is segment- or group-relative.  The default
	  action is to ignore FRMSEG0 errors.

1.18	15 March 2000
	* Fix bug in self-relative fixups for several Frame vs. Target
	  cases I never thought could occur until NASM came along.

1.17	2 October 1999
	* Change default behavior of ALINDIF to align segments of the
	  same type according to the actual alignment (which may
	  differ from segment to segment) instead of enforcing a
	  single alignment across all segments of the same type.  This
	  change mimics the MS-LINK behavior.  Using segments of the
	  same type with different alignment is still a mistake.

1.16	8 September 1999
	* Fix bug when encountering multiple different segments with
	  stack combine type (use the first one only).

1.15	6 September 1999
	* Fix bug which didn't display an error if a .LIB file was not
	  found.
	* Implement switches for BLKDEF, BLKEND, and TYPDEF records
	  instead of lumping them into OMFIGN.	As the default action
	  is to ignore these records, you don't have to ignore all
	  OMFIGN records just to ignore these.

1.14	3 September 1999
	* Fix bug where default EXE and MAP filenames were not
	  displayed when using an Automatic Response File.

1.13	25 May 1999
	* Fix bug with not generating .MAP file when /MAP specified
	  without an end-of-field marker.

1.12	16 May 1999
	* Fix bug with DOSSEG segmnent ordering.

1.11	25 June 1998
	* Compare segment and class names case insensitively so as to
	  mimic MS LINK behavior.
	* Fix bug in FIXUPP of Frame Segment, Target External where the
	  wrong variable was used when checking for FRMSEG errors.
	* Round down Frame Base to para boundary before calculating
	  fixups.

1.10	27 April 1998
	* Mark THRINV as ignored.  Apparently, MSVC 8 (and possibly
	  earlier versions) set bit 2 in the method field of a THREAD
	  subrecord in a FIXUPP record.
	* Fix bugs with aliased symbols.
	* Fix spurious error report with BAKPAT records.

1.09	12 March 1998
	* Fix bug in parsing of .LIB file on the command line so that
	  QLINK no longer asks for more .LIB files if one is specified.
	* Implement /OPTHEADER (/OP) to optimize the .EXE file header by
	  rounding the header up to a paragraph boundary instead of a
	  512-byte boundary.

1.08	12 November 1997
	* Wrote the VxD W95DPMI.386 which provides the appropriate
	  DPMI 1.0 functions needed for QLINK to run under Win95.

1.07	8 July 1997
	* Add EXTMAT config option to display message if an external in a
	  module is not referenced by that module.	Presumably (but not
	  always), these references can be deleted from the source file.

1.06	25 June 1995
	* If /MAP but no explicit entry in mapfile field, create one
	  anyway.
	* Fix bug in fixup of far call to extern in a later segment
	  which doesn't start on a para boundary.
	* Fix bug where /NOE didn't work.
	* Fix bug where null para at start of _TEXT not handled.

1.05	8 May 1995
	* Implement /ONERROR:NOEXE.
	* Parse and ignore /NOLOGO.
	* Parse and warn /PACKCODE:nnn.
	* Use FSA to parse .ARF files.
	* Change THRINV from always Fail to Ignore, Warn, Fail.
	* Support BAKPAT records.
	* Support CEXTDEF records.
	* Support LLNAMES records.
	* Treat extra fields in ARF file as EOF.
	* Implement /NOIGNORECASE.

1.04	25 March 1995
	* Allow addition with seg directive, e.g.,
	  DW (seg PGROUP)+10h.	Note that MS-LINK doesn't handle this
	  correctly.
	* Fix bug in handling of OMF FIXUPP records for Frame &
	  Target external for self-relative fixups.  This format is
	  used by MASM 6.10, but neither MASM 5.10b nor 6.11a.

1.03	14 February 1995
	* Allow options occasionally enabled by some Integrated
	  Development Environments which turn off unsupported
	  features such as

	  /NOPACKCODE
	  /NOPACKDATA
	  /NOPACKFUNCTIONS

	* Also allow (and signal warning) for unsupported features

	  /FARCALLTRANSLATION
	  /PACKCODE
	  /PACKDATA
	  /PACKFUNCTIONS

1.02	18 November 1994
	* Fix bug if QLINK is run w/o DPMI host present.
	* Fix misspelling of /NOEXTDICTIONARY.

1.01	26 October 1994
	* Fix bug if searching for library file.
	* Write out minimal sized .EXE file.

1.00	2 October 1994
	* Initial release.
